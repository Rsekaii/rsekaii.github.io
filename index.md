# Rames Nagib AlJneibi - رامس نجيب الجنيبي

Welcome to my personal academic blog and portfolio. I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Machine Learning and preparing for a PhD in Applied Mathematics. I’m passionate about uncovering deep structures in data and mathematics and applying them to real-world systems. 

I previously earned my Master’s in Mathematics and a Bachelor’s in Chemical Engineering. Professionally, I’ve worked across engineering, planning, and strategic roles in the Gas Business where I integrate technical expertise with long-term energy outlooks.
