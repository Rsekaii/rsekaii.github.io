Taking the advice of a dear friend, I should lower the cringe level in my posts & explain more thoroughly why the math I’m writing about is elegant in the first place. 
Following the previous post, another instance of applied Field Theory (Abstract Algebra) has came up in my journey of learning cryptography.
it was imbedded in the construction of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) which is the current global standard for symmetric-key encryptions. 

### Substitution Permutation Network : 

AES follows a structure known as Substitution Permutation Network (SPN) .

The Substitution–Permutation Network (SPN) is a block cipher designs structure that consists of three main steps:

1.	Substitution
Substitution is a transformation that adds non-linearity to the encryption process, typically through the use of S-boxes.
2.	Permutation
Permutation shuffles or repositions bits or bytes in the state to ensure that each layer of the SPN affects all future layers.
3.	Key Mixing
In this step, a secret key is injected to introduce secrecy.
An SPN typically repeats these steps over multiple rounds, which together provide the two fundamental cryptographic properties: confusion and diffusion.



### Advanced Encryption Standard :

Before going through the process of encryption, plaint text are represented as [4x4] matrices of bytes, where input bytes are filled column by column (column-major order).
And keys are expanded to cover all rounds of the AES and from the expanded master key a [4x4] subkey is extracted at each round.
 
Now that the general structure is defined, let us describe the SPN steps used in AES:
1.	Substitution: SubBytes
Using a substitution box (S-box), each element in the state matrix is non-linearly transformed.

3.	Permutation: Permutation in AES is divided into two steps:
a. ShiftRows – Cyclically shifts each row of the state matrix by a fixed offset.

<p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666; margin-top: 0.2rem;">

b. MixColumns – Each column of the matrix is transformed using matrix multiplication with a predetermined matrix over F28\mathbb{F}_{2^8}F28.

  <img src="{{ '/images/AESMixColumns.png' | relative_url }}" alt="High noise" width="45%">
</div>
<p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666; margin-top: 0.2rem;">
  Figure: Second part of permutation step in AES : Shiftrows.
</p>

5.	Key Mixing : Addroundkey 
Each entry in the subkey is XOR with each byte in the permutated matrix.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/AESAddRoundKey.png' | relative_url }}" alt="High noise" width="45%">
</div>
<p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666; margin-top: 0.2rem;">
  Figure: Key mixing step in AES : Addroundkey.
</p>

For a block size of 128 bits (16 bytes) and a key size of 128 bits (other key sizes also exist for AES). The process is as follow :

AddroundKey, followed by 9 rounds of the three steps above, then a final round of the above without Mixcolumns.

So far nothing seems special about AES’s implementation of SPN, but before unravelling the genius work behind what AES the chosen global standard, I unfortunately have to introduce certain mathematical definitions and structures. 


## Abstract Algebra

### Rings and Ideals

$$R$$: A ring $$R$$ is a set equipped with two binary operations $$(R, +, \cdot)$$.

$$I$$: An ideal $$I$$ is a subset of the ring, $$I \subseteq R$$, such that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item For all $$a, b \in I$$, we have $$a + b \in I$$
  \item For all $$r \in R$$ and $$a \in I$$, we have $$r \cdot a \in I$$
\end{itemize}
(This means it's multiplicatively absorbing.)

To clarify the above, I’ll give simple examples:

Let $$\mathbb{Z}$$ be the set of all integers. This forms a ring under addition and multiplication: $$(\mathbb{Z}, +, \cdot)$$. Now consider $$2\mathbb{Z}$$, the set of all even integers — this is an ideal of $$\mathbb{Z}$$. You can check the properties: clearly, any integer times an even number is still even.

### Quotient Rings

Given a ring $$R$$ and an ideal $$I \subseteq R$$, the \textbf{quotient ring} is defined as:

$$
R/I = \{ r + I \mid r \in R \}
$$

This construction defines an equivalence relation:

$$
r_1 \sim r_2 \quad \text{if and only if} \quad r_1 - r_2 \in I
$$

Think of it as a generalization of arithmetic modulo $$n$$.

Here’s an example to make it concrete:

Let $$R = \mathbb{Z}$$ and $$I = 5\mathbb{Z}$$ (clearly an ideal). Then the quotient ring is:

$$
\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z} = \{ \hat{0}, \hat{1}, \hat{2}, \hat{3}, \hat{4} \}
$$

Where $$\hat{0}$$ is the class of all multiples of 5, $$\hat{1}$$ is the class of numbers like $$1 + 5k$$, etc. Another way to write it is:

$$
\hat{a} = \{ a + b \mid b \in 5\mathbb{Z} \}
$$

Some important intermediate steps are skipped, but they’re not critical for appreciating the core idea.



### Into Field Theory

Now, let $$F$$ be any field.

Then $$F[x]$$, the set of all polynomials with coefficients in $$F$$, is actually a ring. (Trust me on this one.)

A polynomial $$g(x)$$ is called \textbf{irreducible over $$F$$} if it cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials in $$F[x]$$.

\textbf{Example:} $$g(x) = x^2 - 2$$ is irreducible over $$\mathbb{Q}$$ (you can't factor it using rational numbers), but it’s reducible over $$\mathbb{R}$$ since $$x = \sqrt{2}$$.

#### Field Extension Technique

We want to extend our base field (say, $$\mathbb{Q}$$) to include a root of an irreducible polynomial like $$\sqrt{2}$$. Then:

$$
E = \mathbb{Q}[x]/(g(x))
$$

is the field extension we’re looking for. It behaves like $$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$$.




#### Theorem :Finite Field Extensions

Let $$F$$ be a finite field with cardinality $$|F| = q$$, where $$q$$ is a power of a prime number.

Let $$f(x)$$ be an irreducible polynomial over $$F$$ of degree $$n$$. Then the extension:

$$
E = F[x]/(f(x))
$$

is a field with exactly $$q^n$$ elements.

important : there are $$q^n$$ distinct elements in the extended field.

---

Adhering to my friend’s advice, I’ll skip the deeper theorems and field-theoretic machinery (maybe I’ll include them in another post someday for those who want the full beauty).
For now, here’s the punchline:

If $$q = p^n$$ for some prime $$p$$, then there exists exactly one field (up to isomorphism) with $$q$$ elements.

Meaning: all finite fields of the same cardinality share the same algebraic structure, even if their elements are written differently.  they are \textbf{isomorphic}.

---

### Putting It All Together

Here’s the neat trick:

\textit{Given any finite field, you can represent it as a quotient ring.}

For example:

$$
\mathbb{F}_{2^4} = \mathbb{F}_2[x]/(f(x)) \quad \text{where } \deg(f) = 4
$$

That’s how abstract algebra hands you the tools to build and extend fields using irreducible polynomials.
Beautiful, isn’t it? no ? ok, lets move on


### Now, Back to the Genius of AES

Hopefully the previous explanations were clear enough to understand how this abstract machinery is applied in AES.

Since AES deals with \textbf{bytes}, each byte is treated as an element in $$\mathbb{F}_{2^8}.$$

Using the neat trick we mentioned earlier, we know that:

$$
\mathbb{F}_{2^8} \cong \mathbb{F}_2[x]/(f(x))
$$

where $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_2$ of degree 8.  
In AES, the polynomial used is:

$$
m(x) = x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1
$$

which is irreducible over $\mathbb{F}_2$ (i.e., it has no roots in $\mathbb{F}_2 = \{0, 1\}$).  
Thus, all bytes in AES are represented as elements of $$\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(m(x)),$$  
meaning they are polynomials modulo $m(x)$.

What we didn’t explicitly mention earlier is that the XOR operation is a binary operation that satisfies all the conditions to replace addition in a field. So:

$$
(\mathbb{F}_{2^8}, \oplus, \cdot)
$$

The above is indeed a field,  and a beautiful one at that.
now let's see it in action

### SubBytes: Non-linearity

The non linear transformation done in the Sbox is : $S(a) = a^{-1}$ .meaning the transformation returns the multiplicative inverse of $a$. 
Since we're in a field, inverses always exist (excluding 0, which is handled separately). To make this efficient, the S-box is implemented as a lookup table of precomputed inverses.
 Then, a simple affine transformation is applied to the result, adding further mixing.



### MixColumns : Matrix Multiplication

Given a $4 \times 4$ AES state matrix, we take a single column and multiply it (on the left) by a fixed matrix over $$\mathbb{F}_{2^8}.$$

The first entry of the resulting column is computed as:

$$
b_0 = (2 \cdot a_0) \oplus (3 \cdot a_1) \oplus (1 \cdot a_2) \oplus (1 \cdot a_3)
$$

Here, all entries are bytes represented as polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_2$.  
So the fixed matrix entries correspond to field elements:

$$
0 \mapsto 0, \quad 1 \mapsto 1, \quad 2 \mapsto x, \quad 3 \mapsto x+1
$$

#### Example : 

Assume:
$$
a_1 = \{0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1\}
$$
This corresponds to the polynomial:
$$
a_1(x) = x^6 + x + 1
$$

Now compute $3 \cdot a_1$. Since $3 = x + 1$, we have:

$$
3 \cdot a_1 = (x + 1)(x^6 + x + 1) \mod m(x)
$$

Expanding:
$$
= x^7 + x^6 + x^2 + 2x + 1
$$

Since we're working over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we reduce coefficients modulo 2.  
Note that $$2x = 0,$$ so this becomes:

$$
3 \cdot a_1 = x^7 + x^6 + x^2 + 1 \mod m(x)
$$

This polynomial has degree less than 8, so we don’t need to reduce further.  
The binary representation is:

$$
\{1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1\}
$$

### Final Reflection 

The level of complexity and structure introduced into AES is simply magnificent.  
Such beauty is difficult to wield so masterfully.

It may well be the case that algebraic constructions like this are standard in cryptography, and my astonishment will fade once I realize this elegance is intrinsic to the craft.  
But for now, I must stop and give my respect to the genius I witness at play.
