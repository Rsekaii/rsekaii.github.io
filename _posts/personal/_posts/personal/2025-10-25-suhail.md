## Introduction

This post introduces **Suhail**, my startup project focused on bringing AI and optimization intelligence to national gas networks. The initiative aims to address inefficiencies in long-term gas planning and feed allocation across multiple processing facilities.

After years of working in gas master planning and witnessing the limitations of existing tools, I decided to build a domain-driven AI system that combines process-engineering logic with modern machine learning and optimization algorithms.

## Vision

Suhail‚Äôs vision is to transform gas and energy planning from manual, reactive spreadsheets into an adaptive, data-driven, and self-optimizing AI platform.  
The first module ‚Äî the **Feed Allocation Optimizer** ‚Äî serves as the foundation for a full AI ‚ÄúGas Brain‚Äù that will eventually integrate power demand forecasting, storage optimization, and scenario simulation.

## Problem

Gas networks face constant volatility caused by renewable energy swings, operational constraints, and compositional variations.  
Traditional planning tools rely heavily on manual expertise and cannot simulate future scenarios effectively.  
Suhail bridges this gap by embedding decades of operational knowledge directly into an AI framework.

---

## Approach

- Build an **AI-powered optimization solver** trained on real operational data to maximize efficiency and profit across plants.  
- Integrate domain heuristics and nonlinear process relationships into the solver‚Äôs logic.  
- Deliver results through an intuitive dashboard designed for planners and decision makers.  
- Ensure compatibility with existing systems for smooth integration.

## Reflection

Suhail represents the intersection of my background in **chemical engineering, mathematics, and machine learning**.  
The project is built entirely in-house with a scalable architecture to enable smooth onboarding of developers once funding is secured.  
It embodies the belief that AI solutions for energy must be built *from inside the industry* ‚Äî by those who truly understand it.
