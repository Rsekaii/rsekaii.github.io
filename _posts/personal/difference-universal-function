## Introduction

Before diving into the elegant mathematics behind secure constructions, we first introduce key cryptographic concepts that motivate their formulation.

---

## Message Authentication Codes (MAC)

In cryptography, **MACs** (Message Authentication Codes) are used to ensure:

- **Integrity**: the message has not been altered
- **Authenticity**: the message was truly generated by the sender

A MAC takes a message and a secret key to generate a short tag. This tag is then sent along with the message. Anyone who knows the secret key can verify the tag, but forging a valid tag without the key is computationally infeasible.

$$
\text{Tag} = \mathrm{MAC}_k(m)
$$

Where:

- \( m \): the message  
- \( k \): the secret key  
- \( \mathrm{MAC}_k \): the keyed MAC function

---

## Key Definitions

### Pseudorandom Function (PRF)

A function that takes a truly random seed (e.g., a key) and stretches it into a longer output that is indistinguishable from a truly random function to any efficient adversary.

### \( \varepsilon \)-Difference-Universal Function

A function \( f \) is \( \varepsilon \)-difference-universal if for any distinct inputs \( x_1 \neq x_2 \) and any difference \( d \), the probability that

$$
f(x_1) = f(x_2)
$$

is at most \( \varepsilon \).  
**Key Idea:** Output differences are nearly uniform and unpredictable.

### Strongly Secure MAC

A MAC is strongly secure if it resists forgery even when an adversary can adaptively query the MAC oracle and then attempts to forge a new, valid message–tag pair.

---

## A Strongly Secure MAC Construction

Let \( h \) be an \( \varepsilon \)-difference-universal function for negligible \( \varepsilon \), and let \( F \) be a pseudorandom function. Then the following defines a secure MAC for messages \( m \in \mathcal{M}_n \), where \( n \) is the security parameter.

### Step 1 — Key Generation

Given input \( 1^n \):

- Generate \( k_h \in \mathcal{K}_n \) (key for \( h \))  
- Generate \( k_F \in \{0,1\}^n \) (key for PRF)

Output the key pair:
$$
k = (k_h, k_F)
$$

---

### Step 2 — Tag Generation (Mac)

Given \( (k_h, k_F) \) and message \( m \in \mathcal{M}_n \), choose a random \( r \in \{0,1\}^n \), and compute:

$$
t := \langle r,\; h_{k_h}(m) + F_{k_F}(r) \rangle
$$

> This step adds randomness via the PRF and applies the key-function on the message.

---

### Step 3 — Verification (Vrfy)

Given \( (k_h, k_F) \), \( m \), and tag \( t = \langle r, s \rangle \), output 1 if and only if:

$$
s = h_{k_h}(m) + F_{k_F}(r)
$$

✅ This is a **strongly secure MAC scheme**.

## Algebraic Foundations of Elegance

To construct a function like \( h_k \), we turn to algebra. Below are key algebraic structures that form the backbone of secure function design.

---

## Algebraic Structures

### Group

A **group** is a set \( G \) with a binary operation \( \cdot \) such that:

- **Closure:** \( a \cdot b \in G \)  
- **Associativity:** \( (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) \)  
- **Identity:** \( \exists e \in G \) with \( a \cdot e = a \)  
- **Inverses:** \( \forall a \in G, \exists a^{-1} \in G \) with \( a \cdot a^{-1} = e \)

**Examples**:

- \( (\mathbb{Z}, +) \): identity is 0, inverse of \( a \) is \( -a \)  
- \( (\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}, \cdot) \): identity is 1, inverse of \( a \) is \( \frac{1}{a} \)

---

### Abelian Group

A group \( (G, +) \) is **abelian** if:

$$
a + b = b + a
$$

---

### Ring

A **ring** \( R \) has two operations \( + \) and \( \cdot \) such that:

- \( (R, +) \) is an abelian group  
- \( \cdot \) is associative  
- **Distributive laws:**
  - \( a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c \)
  - \( (a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c \)

---

### Commutative Ring

A ring \( R \) is **commutative** if:

$$
a \cdot b = b \cdot a
$$

---

### Field

A **field** is a commutative ring \( F \) where \( 1 \neq 0 \), and every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse:

$$
\forall a \in F \setminus \{0\}, \; \exists a^{-1} \in F \text{ such that } a \cdot a^{-1} = 1
$$

Then:

- \( (F, +) \) is an abelian group  
- \( (F \setminus \{0\}, \cdot) \) is also an abelian group

---

### Finite Field

A **finite field** (or **Galois field**) has finitely many elements. These exist only when the size is a power of a prime:

$$
|\mathbb{F}| = p^n
$$

for some prime \( p \) and integer \( n \geq 1 \). Common notations:

- \( \mathbb{F}_p \)  
- \( \mathrm{GF}(p^n) \)

---

This algebraic groundwork sets the stage for designing difference-universal hash functions — which we'll explore next.
